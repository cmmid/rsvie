\usage{
convert_to_outcomes(object, yrsum = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object containing the necessary data for processing.}

\item{yrsum}{An integer specifying the number of years to summarize. Default is 2.}
}
\value{
A list containing the following elements:
\item{outcomes}{A data frame with weekly outcomes by age group.}
\item{costs}{A data frame with discounted costs by outcome and age group.}

\description{
This function processes an object to calculate various health outcomes over time.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Extracts necessary data from the input object.
\item Calculates the proportion of individuals in different states over time.
\item Estimates the incidence of various health outcomes for vaccinated and unvaccinated groups.
\item Computes the protected incidence for different health outcomes.
\item Aggregates the results to provide weekly outcomes, costs, and QALYs by age group.
\item Applies discounting to costs and QALYs.
